# Quick-API-Key-Generator

A quick and easy way to generate API Keys for OnBase using the Username and Password. I've found this to be helpful when the need arises to store the credentials or in use with the RestAPI so that users only need to "login" once. The API Key can be generated and stored, then decrypted and passed to either the Rest API or the OnBase API.

## Usage

1. Generate a a new key and replace the now public key that is in the code.
2. Use this code in your project.
